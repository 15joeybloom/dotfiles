# 15joeybloom's dotfiles

## Installation

Run `make_links.sh` to create symlinks in your home directory
to the appropriate dotfiles contained herein. Make sure you
backup your existing dotfiles in case you don't like mine!

Insert `bash_profile_snippet.sh` into your `~/.bash_profile`
or other shell dotfile as well. This will load aliases and
my custom prompt.

Import `emacs.itermkeymap` into an iterm2 profile by editting the profile ->
keys tab -> (gear) presets... -> Import...
